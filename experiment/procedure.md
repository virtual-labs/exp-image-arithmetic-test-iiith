The experiment is design to understand and learn the image arithmetic concepts. This experiment consists five parts:

1. Image addition

2. Image Subtraction

3. Image Difference

4. Image Multiplication

5. Image Division

**Steps to run the experiments**

1. Select image from the mosaic using 'select imag' option

   1. Select region of the image to load it in the input image panel

   2. Select secondary image by choosing either of the 'dull' , 'bright' or 'gradient' images

 2. Select one option from 'addition', 'subtraction', 'difference', 'multiplication' and 'division'

   1. Select the one option from 'clipping' and 'auto-scaling'

3. Select run option to perform the operations

   1. Output result will be displayed in the output panel

   2. Along with intermediate results

Interesting Observations

1. Do the Subtraction and Difference operations, and compare the results.

2. Do the Multiplication operation first with clipping and then with auto-scaling, and compare the results.
